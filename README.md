temp
====

Prints the temperature of my CPU cores and HDDs.

I wrote this script because the other tools I found don't report my hard drive temperatures and include a bunch of other stuff that doesn't interest me.

You probably need to `sudo apt-get install lm-sensors hddtemp` for this to work, but I forget.
